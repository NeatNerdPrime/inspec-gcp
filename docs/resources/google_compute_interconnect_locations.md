## Syntax
A `google_compute_interconnect_locations` is used to test a Google InterconnectLocation resource

## Examples
```
describe google_compute_interconnect_locations(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec') do
  its('names') { should include 'akl-zone1-1353' }
  its('facility_provider_facility_ids') { should include 'Auckland - Albany' }
end
```

## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_interconnect_locations` resource:

See [google_compute_interconnect_location.md](google_compute_interconnect_location.md) for more detailed information
  * `creation_timestamps`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` creation_timestamp
  * `descriptions`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` description
  * `ids`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` id
  * `names`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` name
  * `availability_zones`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` availability_zone
  * `client_operation_ids`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` client_operation_id
  * `facility_providers`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` facility_provider
  * `facility_provider_facility_ids`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` facility_provider_facility_id
  * `statuses`: an array of `google_compute_interconnect_location` status

## Filter Criteria
This resource supports all of the above properties as filter criteria, which can be used
with `where` as a block or a method.

## GCP Permissions
